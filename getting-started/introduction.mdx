**Open Interpreter** lets LLMs run code (Python, Javascript, Shell, and more) locally. 

You can chat with Open Interpreter through a ChatGPT-like interface in your terminal by running `$ interpreter` after installing.

This provides a natural-language interface to your computer's general-purpose capabilities:

-   Create and edit photos, videos, PDFs, etc.
-   Control a Chrome browser to perform research
-   Plot, clean, and analyze large datasets
-   ...etc.

**To get started**, [open your terminal](https://chat.openai.com/share/ce4a2266-6901-4d1a-ada6-de1f2b17873b) and paste the following text:

```bash
pip install open-interpreter
interpreter
```
