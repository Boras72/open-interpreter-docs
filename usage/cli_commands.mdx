## Installation
```bash
pip install open-interpreter
```
This command installs the Open Interpreter package using the Python package manager, pip. It allows you to easily set up Open Interpreter on your local environment.

## Running Interpreter
### Default Mode

```bash
interpreter
```

Running this command opens the Open Interpreter in the terminal. It provides an interactive interface for users to communicate with the language models (by default GPT-4), enabling them to run code and perform various tasks.

### Fast Mode

```bash
interpreter --fast
```

This command allows you to set the Open Interpreter to use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model in fast mode. It is particularly useful for quicker responses in the interactive chat.

### Local Mode

```bash
interpreter --local
```

Running Open Interpreter in local mode using this command enables the use of `Code Llama`, which allows for code execution in a local environment. This provides more flexibility and control over the execution.

### Using Specific Hugging Face Model

```bash
interpreter --model tiiuae/falcon-180B
```

This command allows you to run any Hugging Face model locally by specifying its repository ID. In this example, the model with the ID `tiiuae/falcon-180B` is selected for execution.

### Setting Max Tokens and Context Window

```bash
interpreter --max_tokens 2000 --context_window 16000
```

By using these optional parameters, you can easily modify the `max_tokens` and `context_window` (in tokens) of locally running models. Adjusting the context window can help manage memory usage, especially if GPU resources are limited.

### Using Azure OpenAI

```bash
interpreter --use-azure
```

This command is used to set up a connection to an Azure deployment. It will guide you through the process of configuring Open Interpreter to work with an Azure deployment.

### Debugging

Enabling debug mode with this command provides highly detailed and verbose output. This can be useful for contributors or users who need to inspect Open Interpreter for debugging purposes.

Usage before starting the chat:
```bash
interpreter --debug
```
Once you're in the chat
```
> %debug true <- Turns on debug mode
> %debug false <- Turns off debug mode
```
