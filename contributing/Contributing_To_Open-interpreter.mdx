Thank you for expressing interest in contributing to Open Interpreter. Your contributions play a pivotal role in our mission to build a universal interface between language models and computers.

# Our Collective Goals

As an open-source endeavor, we're committed to collaborative efforts to refine and enhance Open Interpreter. Here's where your expertise can help us achieve our collective aspirations:

## Roadmap

We're actively developing a public roadmap to offer transparency regarding our priorities and upcoming enhancements.

At present, our primary focus lies in refining CodeLlama integration and ensuring the core interpreter logic remains straightforward and comprehensible. Our objective is to empower non-coders by enabling natural language to be translated into executable actions.

In this vein, we strive to maintain a streamlined codebase rather than overly complicating it. Our aim is to democratize coding - transforming words into actions - for individuals without extensive coding experience. We welcome dialogues on how best to uphold this approach while incorporating new functionalities.

## Reporting Issues

If you come across a bug or have a compelling feature in mind, please don't hesitate to [open a new issue](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter/issues/new/choose). To expedite an effective response, kindly include the following:

- **Bug Reports:** Provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue, specifics about your operating system and Python version, along with any relevant screenshots and code/error snippets.
- **Feature Requests:** Furnish a comprehensive explanation of how your concept benefits Open Interpreter and its community.

## Contributing Code

We wholeheartedly welcome code contributions through pull requests. To ensure smooth integration, please adhere to these guidelines:

- Before embarking on substantial code changes, we encourage you to discuss your ideas on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6p3fD6rBVm) to verify their alignment with our project vision. We aim to maintain a user-friendly and approachable codebase.

- Fork the repository and establish a new branch for your work.

- Implement changes with clear code comments elucidating your approach. Endeavor to follow established conventions within the codebase.

- Initiate a PR to `main` referencing any pertinent issues. Offer comprehensive context about your alterations.

- We'll conduct reviews of PRs as promptly as possible and collaborate with you to merge your contribution. We appreciate your patience as reviews necessitate time.

- Upon approval, your code will be merged - thank you for enhancing Open Interpreter!

## Running Your Local Fork

After forking the code and creating a new branch for your work, you can execute the fork in CLI mode by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the project folder `/open-interpreter`.
2. Install dependencies with `poetry install`.
3. Execute the program with `poetry run interpreter`.

Upon modifying the source code, remember to re-run `poetry run interpreter`.

### Installing New Packages

If you wish to integrate new dependencies into the project, kindly use `poetry add package-name`.

### Known Issues

For some, `poetry install` may encounter hang-ups with certain dependencies. Initially, attempt the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.fail.Keyring
```
Then re-run `poetry install`. If this proves ineffective, please join our Discord community for assistance.
