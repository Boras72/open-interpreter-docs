---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our documentation! Your contributions are valuable in our mission to build a universal interface between language models and computers.

There are various ways you can contribute, from suggesting improvements to the content, fixing typos, to adding new sections. Your efforts are highly appreciated.

## Our Mission

Our mission with Open Interpreter has been very clear, similarly we are working towards making the docs be the most accesible place to go through, even for non coders, to easily be able to understand, and debug the problems they face with Open Interpreter.

To maintain this accessibility, we strive to keep our documentation straightforward and easy to understand. We welcome discussions on how to uphold this approach while incorporating new features and capabilities.

## Running Locally

After forking the repository and creating a new branch for your work, you can preview the documentation locally by following these steps:
1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Once git is installed, clone your docs repository using 
```
git clone https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter-docs
```
3. Navigate to the project directory `/open-interpreter-docs`
4. Open the directory in your preffered IDE
5. Install the Mintlify CLI with `npm i -g mintlify` in your terminal -- [[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) >=v19.00.0 required].
6. Run `mintlify dev` to start the local server
